The **Command-Line BMI Calculator in Python** is a simple yet effective program designed to help users quickly determine their Body Mass Index (BMI). By prompting the user to input their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters), the program calculates the BMI using the standard formula: BMI = weight / (height^2). Once the BMI is calculated, the program then classifies the result into predefined categories such as underweight, normal, or overweight based on widely accepted BMI ranges. The final output provides the user with their exact BMI value along with their corresponding weight category, offering a clear and concise assessment of their health based on BMI.
